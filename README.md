stickyNotes is a MERN stack application built to replace the traditional sticky note tracking system used in workplaces. It supports secure user authentication, role-based access control (Employees, Managers, Admins), and intuitive note management. Users can create, view, update, and manage task-based notes, each with a unique ticket number and status (OPEN or COMPLETED). The app also provides an admin panel for user management and is optimized for desktop, with responsive support for mobile devices.
